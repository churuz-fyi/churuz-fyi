### Student SWE with a lot of obsessions👋

[LINKS](https://link.ruz.fyi) | Computers are really interesting. Good thing I like them.

## You may catch me doing one of the following
- Writing a CLI tool in C (or learning how to)
- Making little webapps for fun
- Reconfiguring my Linux machines
- Clearning the gunpla backlog 😐
- Making a game on Godot
- Reading something really nerdy 🤓
